Vagrant is stuck: "Authentication failure. Retrying..."


Solution:

You can unstick the vagrant machine, but it involves some careful copying and pasting.
Find the IdentityFile vagrant is using:

$ vagrant ssh-config
Host default
  HostName 127.0.0.1
  User vagrant
  Port 2222
  UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null
  StrictHostKeyChecking no
  PasswordAuthentication no
  IdentityFile /Users/ned/.vagrant.d/insecure_private_key
  IdentitiesOnly yes
  LogLevel FATAL
$

Look in the IdentityFile to see the public key. This will be a long line (380 characters or so):
$ ssh-keygen -y -f /Users/ahmad/.vagrant.d/insecure_private_key
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIwAAA...rucXzcWyLbIbEgE98OHlnVYCzRdK8jlqm8tehUc9c9WhQ==
$


Log in to the vagrant machine with the password "vagrant":

$ ssh -p 2222 -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null vagrant@127.0.0.1
The authenticity of host '[127.0.0.1]:2222 ([127.0.0.1]:2222)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is dc:48:73:c3:18:e4:9d:34:a2:7d:4b:20:6a:e7:3d:3e.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
Warning: Permanently added '[127.0.0.1]:2222' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.

$

Add the public key to the authorized_keys file. You need to copy the entire ssh-rsa line from the ssh-keygen command above, and paste it here, then type Control-D to end the command:

vagrant@vagrant:~$ cat >> /home/vagrant/.ssh/authorized_keys
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIwAAA...rucXzcWyLbIbEgE98OHlnVYCzRdK8jlqm8tehUc9c9WhQ==
<Ctrl-D>
vagrant@vagrant:~$

Log out of the vagrant machine and halt it:
vagrant@vagrant:~$ exit
logout
Connection to 127.0.0.1 closed.
$ vagrant halt

Bring up the vagrant machine again:
$ vagrant up
